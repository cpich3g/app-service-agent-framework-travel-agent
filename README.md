# App Service Agent Framework Travel Planner

A demonstration of building asynchronous, long-running AI applications using the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview) on Azure App Service. This sample showcases server-side persistent agents with conversation threads, background processing with Service Bus, and state management with Cosmos DB.

See the blog post for more details: [Build Long-Running AI Agents on Azure App Service with Microsoft Agent Framework](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/build-long-running-ai-agents-on-azure-app-service-with-microsoft-agent-framework/4463159)

## What is Agent Framework?

The [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview) is a comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and managing AI agents. Unlike simple chat completions, Agent Framework provides:

- **Persistent Agents**: Server-side agents that maintain context across multiple interactions
- **Conversation Threads**: Organized conversation history and state management
- **Agent Runs**: Structured execution with progress tracking and lifecycle management
- **Multi-Turn Interactions**: Complex workflows with iterative AI processing
- **Tool Integration**: Extensible function calling and integration capabilities

This demo uses Azure AI Foundry's implementation of Agent Framework with GPT-4o to generate detailed, multi-day travel itineraries.

## Why Azure App Service?

This entire application runs on **Azure App Service** with a combined API and background worker in a single deployment:

✅ **Simplified Architecture**: One App Service hosting both web API and background processing  
✅ **Cost-Effective**: Single P0v4 Premium instance handles both workloads  
✅ **Managed Platform**: No infrastructure management, automatic scaling, built-in load balancing  
✅ **Always On**: Keeps background worker running continuously without cold starts  
✅ **Enterprise Features**: Custom domains, SSL, deployment slots, VNet integration  
✅ **Managed Identity**: Secure, credential-less authentication to all Azure services

For production workloads requiring independent scaling, you can separate the API and worker into distinct App Services.

## Why Async Pattern with State Storage?

### The Challenge: Long-Running Agent Framework Flows

Agent Framework enables building AI agents that execute complex, multi-step workflows:

- **Multiple LLM Calls**: Iterative reasoning with GPT-4o, tool/function calling, context building
- **Chain of Thought**: Multi-turn interactions where each response informs the next prompt
- **External Integrations**: API calls for real-time data (weather, prices, availability)
- **Complex Processing**: Budget calculations, itinerary optimization, content generation

**These workflows can take several minutes to complete** - far too long for a synchronous HTTP request.

### App Service Constraints

Running long-running operations directly in HTTP request handlers creates problems:

**⏱️ Request Timeouts**
- App Service has a **230-second default timeout** for HTTP requests
- Load balancers may timeout even sooner (30-120 seconds)
- Agent Framework travel itinerary generation (on similar long running operations in other examples): 30-90 seconds depending on complexity

**🔌 Connection Drops**
- Clients may disconnect due to network issues, browser navigation, or timeouts
- Lost connections mean lost work - the agent completes but client never receives result
- Mobile clients are especially prone to intermittent connectivity

**📈 Scalability Issues**
- **Scale-Out**: When App Service scales horizontally, new instances don't have in-flight request state
- **Restarts**: Deployments, updates, or auto-heal restarts lose all in-progress requests
- **Resource Contention**: Long-running requests block worker threads, reducing throughput

**🎯 User Experience**
- Users stare at loading spinners for minutes with no progress updates
- No way to close browser and check back later
- Failed requests must be retried from scratch

### The Solution: Async Request-Reply + Durable State

This demo implements the **[Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/async-request-reply)** with durable state storage:

**1. Immediate Response (202 Accepted)**
```
Client → POST /api/travel-plans
API → Queue message to Service Bus
API → Return 202 with taskId (< 100ms)
```

**2. Background Processing**
```
Worker → Receive message from Service Bus
Worker → Execute Agent Framework workflow
Worker → Update progress in Cosmos DB (10% → 100%)
Worker → Store result in Cosmos DB
```

**3. Status Polling**
```
Client → Poll GET /api/travel-plans/{taskId}
API → Read from Cosmos DB (5-10ms)
API → Return status + progress percentage
```

**4. Result Retrieval**
```
Client → GET /api/travel-plans/{taskId}
API → Read completed itinerary from Cosmos DB
API → Return full result
```

### Why This Pattern Works

**✅ No Timeouts**: API returns immediately, Agent Framework runs in background  
**✅ Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates (10%, 45%, 100%) stored in Cosmos DB  
**✅ Resilient**: Survives app restarts, scale events, network interruptions  
**✅ Scalable**: Workers process queue messages independently, can scale to N instances  
**✅ Better UX**: Users can close browser, check back later, see progress updates  

**Without Cosmos DB**, there would be no durable state - deployments would lose all in-flight tasks, progress updates would be lost on scale-out, and clients would have no way to check status after disconnection.

## State Management: Cosmos DB vs Redis

This demo uses **Azure Cosmos DB** for state management. Here's why and how it compares to Redis:

### Why Cosmos DB?

**✅ Document-Based Storage**
- Natural fit for complex travel itineraries (nested JSON)
- Single atomic write/read for complete documents
- No need to serialize/deserialize complex objects into key-value pairs

**✅ Rich Query Capabilities**
- Query tasks by status, user, date range, destination
- Filter and sort without loading entire dataset
- Enables analytics and reporting

**✅ Automatic TTL**
- Built-in time-to-live at document level (24 hours)
- No background cleanup jobs needed
- Cosmos handles expiration automatically

**✅ Multi-Region Support**
- Global distribution for worldwide deployments
- Automatic replication and failover
- Read from nearest region

**✅ ACID Transactions**
- Strong consistency guarantees
- Transactions across multiple documents
- Critical for financial/booking integrations

**✅ No Memory Limits**
- Storage-based pricing (not memory-based)
- No eviction pressure on frequently accessed items
- Scales independently of memory

### When to Use Redis Instead

**Redis is better when:**

**⚡ Ultra-Low Latency Required** (< 1ms)
- High-frequency trading, real-time bidding
- Sub-millisecond response critical
- Cosmos: ~5-10ms single-region, still excellent for most use cases

**📊 Simple Key-Value Patterns**
- Session tokens, feature flags, rate limiting
- Leaderboards, counters, pub/sub
- No complex queries or relationships needed

**💾 In-Memory Caching**
- Cache-aside pattern with another database
- Frequently accessed hot data
- Willing to handle cache invalidation complexity

**💰 Predictable Costs**
- Fixed monthly cost based on instance size
- Low request volume with unpredictable spikes
- Cosmos: Pay-per-request can be higher for very low volumes

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | Cosmos DB | Redis (Premium with Persistence) |
|---------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **Latency (Read)** | 5-10ms single-region | < 1ms |
| **Data Model** | Documents (JSON) | Key-Value pairs |
| **Query Support** | SQL-like queries, filters | Limited (keys, scans) |
| **Automatic TTL** | ✅ Per document | ✅ Per key |
| **Persistence** | ✅ Always persisted | ⚠️ Optional (Premium) |
| **Multi-Region** | ✅ Built-in global distribution | ❌ Manual replication |
| **Complex Data** | ✅ Native JSON support | ⚠️ Serialize to strings |
| **Transactions** | ✅ ACID across documents | ⚠️ Limited to single instance |
| **Scaling** | Automatic (throughput or autoscale) | Manual (cache size tiers) |
| **Pricing Model** | Pay-per-request or provisioned RU/s | Fixed monthly (instance size) |
| **Best For** | Complex state, queries, global apps | Session cache, ultra-low latency |

### Recommendation

- **Use Cosmos DB** (this demo): Complex itineraries, query requirements, automatic TTL, global distribution
- **Use Redis**: Session storage, rate limiting, leaderboards, < 1ms latency critical
- **Use Both**: Redis for hot cache + Cosmos DB for durable storage (cache-aside pattern)

    ]
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Worker Not Processing Messages

1. **Check Service Bus queue:**
   ```bash
   az servicebus queue show \
     --name travel-plans \
     --namespace-name sb-<unique-id> \
     --resource-group rg-<env-name> \
     --query "countDetails"
   ```

2. **Verify managed identity roles:**
   - App Service identity needs "Azure Service Bus Data Receiver" role
   - Check Azure Portal → Service Bus → Access Control (IAM)

3. **Check dead letter queue:**
   ```bash
   # View dead lettered messages
   az servicebus queue show \
     --name travel-plans \
     --namespace-name sb-<unique-id> \
     --resource-group rg-<env-name> \
     --query "countDetails.deadLetterMessageCount"
   ```

### Status Not Updating

1. **Verify Cosmos DB access:**
   - App Service identity needs "Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor" role

2. **Check document TTL:**
   - Tasks expire after 24 hours
   - Verify `ttl` field is set correctly in Cosmos DB container settings

### AI Agent Errors

1. **Check GPT-4o deployment:**
   ```bash
   # List deployments
   az cognitiveservices account deployment list \
     --name ai-<unique-id> \
     --resource-group rg-<env-name>
   ```

2. **Verify quota and throttling:**
   - Check tokens-per-minute (TPM) limit: 50K for GlobalStandard
   - Monitor "ThrottledRequests" metric in Azure Portal
   - Consider increasing deployment quota if hitting rate limits

3. **Agent Framework endpoint:**
   - Verify endpoint format: `https://ai-<unique-id>.openai.azure.com/api/projects/proj-<unique-id>`
   - Ensure AI Project child resource exists under AI Services

## Cleanup

Delete all Azure resources:

```bash
azd down
```

This will delete the resource group and all contained resources (App Service, Service Bus, Cosmos DB, AI Foundry).

## Architecture Benefits

### Async Request-Reply Pattern
- **Immediate Response**: API returns 202 Accepted in <100ms with taskId
- **No HTTP Timeouts**: Long-running Agent Framework work happens asynchronously
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Workers can scale independently based on queue depth
- **Reliability**: Service Bus guarantees message delivery with automatic retries

### Agent Framework on App Service
- **Persistent Agents**: Server-side agents maintain conversation context across runs
- **Managed Lifecycle**: Agents created per request, cleaned up after completion
- **Thread-Based**: Conversation threads organize multi-turn interactions
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates from agent execution
- **No Infrastructure**: Fully managed on App Service, no containers or orchestrators needed

### State Management with Cosmos DB
- **Document Storage**: Natural fit for complex nested travel itineraries
- **Rich Queries**: Filter tasks by status, date, destination without loading all data
- **Automatic TTL**: 24-hour document expiration, no cleanup jobs needed
- **Global Distribution**: Multi-region replication for worldwide deployments
- **Strong Consistency**: ACID transactions for reliable state updates

### Security with Managed Identity
- **No Secrets**: Zero connection strings or API keys in code or configuration
- **Automatic Rotation**: Azure handles credential lifecycle
- **Least Privilege**: RBAC roles grant only necessary permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Azure AD logs all authentication events
